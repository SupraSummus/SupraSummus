Hi, I'm Jan. A friendly conscious being.

* I like peace, tranquility.
* I like making things.
* I like aquariums and ponds.
* I like simplicity and robustness in solutions.
* I like beer and black coffee.
* I love computers, but only when I'm in control.
* I love postgres. But I don't especially like SQL.
* I like the Python language. For its approachable nature.
* I don't mind paying taxes, because I'm a effing socialist ;)

Now it's getting creepy ;)

* I like big pieces of stainless steel. So durable!
* I like controlled fire. Like in an engine or furnace.
* I like water pumps and air pumps. Pond cascades and air purifiers.

I like sci-fi and fantasy that has great world-building, attention to detail and emphasizes big ideas over emotional drama.
For example, Stanisław Lem's "Tales of Pirx the Pilot" and Hayao Miyazaki's "Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind".

I make money building and maintaining software.
